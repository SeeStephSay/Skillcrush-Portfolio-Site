                    <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I live in Norman, Oklahoma, with my fiance, five teenagers, four small dogs, and one big cat! Life is never boring around here! As a high school senior, I was "websmaster" of my school's website, proudly written by myself, entirely in HTML. There may have been glittery, blinking graphics involved, because, hey, it was the early 2000s, and they were all the rage! I had already put myself on a career track to become a teacher, so that's what I went to college for, but over time, I realized that technology has always been my true passion. Now, MANY years later, *ahem* I am finally beginning to realize that dream! I've been studying with Skillcrush's Break Into Tech Blueprint, and they have helped me to build this very website, using their HTML & CSS course! </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p> Now, I'm on track to begin Lambda School's Web23 Bootcamp Class, starting in August of 2019! Ever since I found out that remote jobs were a possibility, they've been my dream. Being able to work anywhere in the world (that has internet!), and not being tied down to one location sounds amazing! I've gotten a small taste of remote work, doing Independent Contractor work as a software tester, but I'm excited to have a full-time CAREER, where I am able to enjoy doing what I love for the rest of my life. I love how coding challenges me, and makes me feel like I'm constantly solving some sort of a puzzle - like I'm Link in a real-life game of Zelda. It's pretty sweet, and I can't wait to see where it takes me! <3</p>

                        <p>My focus is on writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand, to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot, and accessible.</p>
